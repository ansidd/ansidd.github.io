<b>
<p>Essentially a Computer Science Engineer, I am skilled in Machine Learning, Data Science and Engineering. I recently graduated from New York University with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about using Machine Learning to solve complex problems in different domains. I have worked on various projects in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing fields. I have built a <a href="https://ansidd.github.io/video_search.html">Video Search System</a> that uses Dual Encoders, a <a href="https://github.com/ansidd/VisualSearch">Face Search System</a>, a <a href="https://ansidd.github.io/slar.html">Sign Language Alphabet Translator</a> etc. and am currently experimenting with GANs.
<br>
<br>
As a Data Scientist at IBM, in a team of three, I developed ETL Pipeline from scratch and deployed it on the IBM Cloud. I wrote transformation scripts in Python that implemented complex business logic to convert thousands of records of raw data in excel files to hundreds of user-defined KPIs as an automated service that ran every week. I also developed a knowledge graph from raw text data using NLP techniques. 
<br>
<br>
Python is my primary language and I am also skilled in Java, Javascript, C/C++ and C#
