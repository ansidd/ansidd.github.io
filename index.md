<p>Essentially a Computer Science Engineer, I am skilled in Machine Learning, Data Science and Engineering. I recently graduated from New York University with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about using Machine Learning to solve complex problems in different domains. I have worked on various projects in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing fields. I have built a <a href="https://ansidd.github.io/video_search.html">Video Search System</a> that uses Dual Encoders, a <a href="https://github.com/ansidd/VisualSearch">Face Search System</a>, a <a href="https://ansidd.github.io/slar.html">Sign Language Alphabet Translator</a> etc. and am currently experimenting with GANs.
<br>
<br>
As a Data Scientist at IBM, in a team of three, I developed ETL Pipeline from scratch and deployed it on the IBM Cloud. I wrote transformation scripts in Python that implemented complex business logic to convert thousands of records of raw data in excel files to hundreds of user-defined KPIs as an automated service that ran every week. I also developed a knowledge graph from raw text data using NLP techniques. 
<br>
<br>
Python is my primary language and I am also skilled in Java, Javascript, C/C++ and C#

<b>ðŸš€ Experienced Software Engineer | Master's in Computer Science | IBM Alum</b>

I'm a dynamic Software Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from New York University. My expertise spans Machine Learning, Data Science, and Engineering, and I'm passionate about leveraging these skills to tackle complex challenges across various domains.<br/>

At IBM, I excelled as a Cognitive Data Scientist, leading a team in developing a robust ETL Pipeline. I crafted Python scripts, implementing intricate business logic, and seamlessly deployed the pipeline via IBM cloud functions. This automated marvel streamlined data loads and manipulations in the PostgreSQL database, enhancing operational efficiency.<br/>

My project portfolio showcases innovation in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I spearheaded the development of a Video Search System with Dual Encoders, a Face Search System, and a Sign Language Alphabet Translator. Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), pushing the boundaries of AI.<br/>

With proficiency in Python, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and C#, I'm well-equipped to take on multifaceted challenges. My passion for excellence drives me to continually explore and adapt to emerging technologies.<br/>

Let's connect and explore how my skills can contribute to your next project. Feel free to reach out at as15840@nyu.eduâ€”I'm always up for a chat or collaboration!
